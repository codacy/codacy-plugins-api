A dependency free api for codacy-engines

This repository is meant to be the interface between

* Codacy analysis tools (currently via [codacy-engine-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed))
* Codacy duplication tools (currently via [codacy-duplication-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-duplication-scala-seed))
* Codacy metrics tools (currently via [codacy-metrics-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-metrics-scala-seed))
* The tests with [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test)
* Codacy's internal component running tools and picking up their results


TEST DONT MEEEEERGE


It's held dependency free so we are flexible on changing (versions of) mainly json-libraries on the components that use it.
